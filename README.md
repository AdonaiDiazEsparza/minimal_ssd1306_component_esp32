## Description

This component was specifically designed for resource-constrained ESP32 applications that require fast and efficient visualization on OLED screens based on the ssd1306 controller.

It focuses on core functionality to achieve the lowest possible memory and storage footprint, intentionally avoiding the heavy abstractions and complex features found in larger libraries. 

### Key Features:

‚úÖ Native support for the ESP-IDF framework.

‚ú® Minimalist Design: Extremely low code and memory load.

üñ•Ô∏è Compatibility: Fully compatible with 128x32 and 128x64 OLED displays based on the SSD1306 controller.

‚öôÔ∏è Easy Integration: Included as a standard ESP-IDF component.
